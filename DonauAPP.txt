DonauApp – MVP Design & Front-End Delivery 
Proposal (Final) 
1. Project Overview 
DonauApp is an AI-powered B2B platform that connects brands with verified manufacturers 
through intelligent brief creation, automated matching, and proposal-based collaboration. 
The objective of this MVP is to validate the core workflow: 
Brief Creation → Manufacturer Matching → Proposal & Collaboration 
This proposal covers UI/UX design (Figma) and front-end development only, aligned with the 
client’s Go-based, server-rendered architecture. 
2. Scope of Work 
A. UI/UX Design (Figma) 
● High-fidelity desktop-first UI designs 
● Brand and Manufacturer user flows 
● Complete Tailwind Design System & reusable components 
● High-fidelity Marketing Website UI (desktop) 
● UX structured to support server-side rendering and templates 
Important Note (Budget Alignment) 
To optimize cost and timelines: 
● Mobile-specific Figma designs are excluded 
● Desktop designs will act as the single source of truth 
● Responsiveness(Mobile) will be implemented during front-end development 
B. Front-End Development (Responsive) 
● Plain HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript 
● Fully responsive implementation (desktop, mobile) 
● Server-rendering–friendly templates 
● Component-based structure for reuse 
● Responsive navigation, forms, grids, and tables 
● Loading, empty, and error states 
Technology Alignment ( no backend work just alignment) 
● Go-based backend 
● Template-based server-side rendering 
● No SPA frameworks assumed 
3. MVP Functional Coverage 
A. Brand User Flows 
● Onboarding & account setup 
● AI-assisted and manual brief creation 
● Manufacturer matching & comparison 
● Proposal review, counter-offers, acceptance 
● Messaging with AI chat assistant 
B. Manufacturer User Flows 
● Business verification & capability setup 
● Brief review & filtering 
● Proposal creation & submission 
● Project pipeline & updates 
● Messaging & AI assistance 
C. Shared System Screens 
● Authentication 
● Notifications 
● Account settings 
● Error and empty states 
4. Marketing Website (UI + Front-End) 
● 4–5 pages (desktop UI design) 
○ Home (Lead generation) 
○ About 
○ Services 
○ Contact 
○ Optional: Blog / FAQs 
● Fully responsive front-end implementation 
5. Estimated Screen Count (MVP) 
Web App (Desktop UI Designs) 
● Brand flows: 20–25 screens 
● Manufacturer flows: 18–22 screens 
● Shared screens: 5–6 screens 
Total Web App: ~40–50 screens 
Marketing Website 
● 4–5 screens (desktop UI) 
Grand Total: ~44–55 screens 
6. Execution Strategy 
● Week 1: Design-only phase (foundation & direction lock) 
● Week 2 onward: Parallel execution 
● UI/UX design remains one week ahead of development 
● Responsive behavior handled during development phase 
7. Timeline & Milestone Roadmap 
Total Duration: 
5–6 Weeks 
(Extended beyond the original 4-week request to ensure quality and responsiveness)

9. Key Clarifications 
● Mobile responsiveness is included 
● Mobile Figma designs are excluded to stay within budget 
● Desktop designs serve as the baseline 
● Timeline includes buffer to reduce delivery risk
